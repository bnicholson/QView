The csv files have the following structure.

Each quiz consists of a number of events.  An event could be anything
associated with an occurence in the quiz.  Events are unique in the
$key4server, $tournament, $division, $room, $round, question, event.


  $key4server,$tournament,$division,$room,$round,question,eventnum,$name,
	team,quizzer,$event,$parm1,$parm2,$parm3,$ts

Variables with a $ in front are strings, all others are integers

$key4server: This is a unique id (hopefully globally but not guaranteed).
	     Someday in the future we'll convert this to uuid.

$tournament: This is the name of the tournament itself.

$division: The division

$room: What room is this quizzing event in.
$round: What round is this event in

question: This is the question number. So if a jump, error, challenge, appeal
	  and foul all occur in a question all will have the same question
	  number.
	  
eventnum: This is a number that helps us have multiple events in each question.

$name: This is usually the name of the quizzer involved in the event but it
       can be a number of other items.
       
team:  Team number.  Starts at 0.  A two team quiz would have 0, and 1.  A
       three team quiz would have 0,1 and 2.
quizzer:  Quizzer number: Zero based.  0-4 for a five person team.
$event: Event identifier.

$parm1: String parameter that depends upon the event type
$parm2: String parameter that depends upon the event type
$parm3: String parameter that depends upon the event type
$ts: Timestamp - 'YYYY-MM-DD-hh.mm.ss.mmmmmm'
     YYYY - year, i.e. 2022
     MM - month
     DD - day
     hh - hour 24 based
     mm - minute
     ss - second
     mmmmmm - milliseconds
